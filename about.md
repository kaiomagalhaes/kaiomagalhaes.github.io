Software developer since 2012 i worked on several projects, both desktop and web. Today i focus on web solutions, always searching for the best for the final user. I do Software Engineering in Universidade Federal de Goi√°s - Brasil and besides programming i love economic and administrative issues.

For me programming is not just work, it's my profession and something i do for love.

Programming is the way to do that which makes things make sense, which is to deliver a product with clean code , well structured and well tested.

In my spare time when i not programming i like to read, cook and play sports in general.

## Back end skills

Most of my time as a programmer was invested in back end development, mostly because of the jobs that i picked. I started as a Java programmer, after o work with Groovy, Groovy on Grails and NodeJS.
Today i use ruby in most of my personal projects (you can see them [here](https://github.com/kaiomagalhaes))

I have the chance to work with great developers with which i learned to work agile methodologies and that a team that talk can make anything possible(including laughing solving bugs that can make the whole team fired)

In addition to programming also had the chance to work with management and automation servers.
