title: About

I've been working as a software developer since early 2012, for both
desktop and web. My current focus is on web solutions, I’m always
looking for the best user experience. I'm a Software Engineer major at
Universidade Federal de Goiás - UFG.

Programming is more than just a profession for me, it's a lifestyle,
something I do out of love for my craft. I always strive for a well made
product, with good architecture, clean and well tested code.

When I'm not programming, I like to read, cook, and practice sports in
general.
