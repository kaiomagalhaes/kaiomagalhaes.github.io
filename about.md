I've been working as a software developer since 2012, for both the desktop and the web. My current focus is on web solutions, always focusing on providing the best experience for the user.I'm a Software Engineering major at UFG - Universidade Federal de Goiás.

For me, programming is more than just a profession: it's a way of life, It's something I love

Programming is the way to do that which makes things make sense, which is to deliver a product with clean code , well structured and well tested.

In my spare time when i not programming i like to read, cook and play sports in general.

## Back end skills

Most of my time as a programmer was invested in back end development, mostly because of the jobs that i picked. I started as a Java programmer, after o work with Groovy, Groovy on Grails and NodeJS.
Today i use ruby in most of my personal projects (you can see them [here](https://github.com/kaiomagalhaes))

I have the chance to work with great developers with which i learned to work agile methodologies and that a team that talk can make anything possible(including laughing solving bugs that can make the whole team fired)

In addition to programming also had the chance to work with management and automation servers.

## Front end skills

A interface com o usuário simplesmente me encanta. Afinal a forma é feita delimita toda a experiência, estado e futuro de um sistema. Tive a chance de trabalhar com vários frameworks que vão desde estilos da página até efeitos. Trabalhei não só na construção de interfaces como nos testes das mesmas, testes automatizados de comportanto e de estado para front end.
