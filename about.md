I've been working as a software developer since early 2012, for both the desktop and the web. My current focus is on web solutions, always looking for the best end user experience. I'm a Software Engineer major at Universidade Federal de Goi√°s - UFG.

Programming is more than just a profession for me, it's a lifestyle, something I do out of love for my craft. I always strive for a well made product, with a good architecture and a clean, well tested code.

When i'm not programming, I like to read, cook, and practice sports in general.

Most of my time as a programmer has been spent in back-end development. I started as a java programmer at first, moving on to groovy, grails and nodejs. Today, my language of choice for personal projects (which you can see [here](https://github.com/kaiomagalhaes) is ruby.

I've had the chance to work with great developers, with whom I had the chance to not only practice agile methods but also to learn that talking with your peers can help you solve most of your problems. I've also had the oportunity to learn scrum, tdd, bdd and dev-ops.

The user interface, to me, is astouding. After all, its the UI that guides the whole experience. I've had the chance to work with various front-end frameworks, such as AngularJS, Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery, and others. I also have experience writing up automatic interface, behaviour and state tests.
