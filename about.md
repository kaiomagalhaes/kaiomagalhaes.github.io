Software developer since 2012 i worked on several projects, both desktop and web. Today i focus on web solutions, always searching for the best for the final user. I do Software Engineering in Universidade Federal de Goi√°s - Brasil and besides programming i love economic and administrative issues.

For me programming is not just work, it's my profession and something i do for love.

In my spare time when i not programming i like to read, cook and play sports in general.
