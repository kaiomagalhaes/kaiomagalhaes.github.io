I"J<p>Here at Codelitt, our projects range from web applications to robotics to augmented reality. However, inside all of those areas, there is a very important and persistent topic: Security. When youâ€™re thinking about security, there are a lot of factors to think about. Are we talking about server access? Information traffic? Information storage? The list goes on and on and on. Security is always top of mind for us and we just released an enterprise security product, <a href="http://www.bovedahq.com">Boveda</a>, that helps non technical people send sensitive data to others.</p>
