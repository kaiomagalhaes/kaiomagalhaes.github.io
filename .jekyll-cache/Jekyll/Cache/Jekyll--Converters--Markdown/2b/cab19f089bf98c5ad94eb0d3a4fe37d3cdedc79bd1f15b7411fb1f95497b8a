<h3 id="my-history">my history</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ve started as a software developer after two years doing Biological
Sciences. I was born to be a crazy scientist ( I discovered it when I was
6 ), but Iâ€™m too stubborn to accept how things are, so I
decided to be a Software Engineer, and that was when my disruption work started.</p>

<p>I got a bachelor in Software Engineering at the <a href="https://www.ufg.br/">Universidade Federal de
GoiÃ¡s</a> in 2016.</p>

<p>My journey began in 2011 when I was a teacher in a tiny college
in <a href="https://www.google.com.br/search?q=goiÃ¢nia&amp;oq=goiÃ¢nia">GoiÃ¢nia</a> and
I had to make all my classes diaries by hand. Every two months I had to
write dots for 300 students. I then saw that I was in charge of a mission
to find a way to make this process better.</p>

<p>My first software never went into production because of three months after I
drop out from that college and from the University only to enter again,
but for a Software Engineer Bachelor this time.</p>

<p>So far Iâ€™ve worked with a lot of projects in a lot of different
languages like PHP, C#, Java, Javascript, Groovy, and Ruby.</p>

<p>With a lot of frameworks like Grails, Rails, React and NodeJS.</p>

<p>For a lot of platforms like Desktop, WEB, Android, and Hololens.</p>

<p>I have worked as a Linux DevOps as well.</p>

<p>I love programming related topics like code quality, software engineer,
best practices, design patterns and I write about it always that I have
time to.</p>

<p>To be honest, Iâ€™m having some trouble remembering right now, so why donâ€™t you check out this <a href="https://blog.codelitt.com/contractor-to-cto/">blogpost</a>,it will answer <strong>all</strong> your questions.</p>
