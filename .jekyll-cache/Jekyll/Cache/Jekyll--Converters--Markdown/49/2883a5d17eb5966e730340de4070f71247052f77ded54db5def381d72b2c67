I"<p>During one of my recent job interviews with a frontend engineer he asked me “Will I be responsible for designing the application as well?”. My first reaction was shock, “Why on earth would I ask an engineer to design an application?”, but this thought was soon replaced with “I too have designed applications a long time ago”. Asking an engineer to design an application is the equivalent of placing a camel on a horse race. The camel can definitely run, but you would rather regret betting on it as the winner, and will possibly end up disappointed with your underperforming camel. The moment I could find my words I explained to him that we always have a designer working alongside with the developer to guarantee the look and feel of the application.</p>
