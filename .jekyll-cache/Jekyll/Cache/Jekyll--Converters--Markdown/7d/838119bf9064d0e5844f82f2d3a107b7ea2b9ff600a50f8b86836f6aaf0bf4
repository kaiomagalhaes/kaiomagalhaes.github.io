I"s<p>Since the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Lambda-Cold_Dark_Matter,_Accelerated_Expansion_of_the_Universe,_Big_Bang-Inflation.jpg">beginning of the time</a> (Disclaimer: possibly not an accurate timeline), we have been suffering from the <em>‘But it’s working in my machine’</em> curse. It happens because we are probably not going to deploy the application in our local machine. Our local machine usually happens to be different than the production one. It can be different in lots of ways e.g: operational system, environment variables, installed dependencies and the list continues.</p>
