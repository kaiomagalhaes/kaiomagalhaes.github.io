### my history

I've started as a software developer after two years doing Biological
Sciences. I was born to be a crazy scientist ( I discovered it when I was
6 ), but I'm too stubborn to accept how things are, so I
decided to be a Software Engineer, and that was when my disruption work started.

I got a bachelor in Software Engineering at the [Universidade Federal de
Goiás](https://www.ufg.br/) in 2016.

My journey began in 2011 when I was a teacher in a tiny college
in [Goiânia](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=goiânia&oq=goiânia) and
I had to make all my classes diaries by hand. Every two months I had to
write dots for 300 students. I then saw that I was in charge of a mission
to find a way to make this process better.

My first software never went into production because of three months after I
drop out from that college and from the University only to enter again,
but for a Software Engineer Bachelor this time.

So far I've worked with a lot of projects in a lot of different
languages like PHP, C#, Java, Javascript, Groovy, and Ruby.

With a lot of frameworks like Grails, Rails, React and NodeJS.

For a lot of platforms like Desktop, WEB, Android, and Hololens.

I have worked as a Linux DevOps as well.

I love programming related topics like code quality, software engineer,
best practices, design patterns and I write about it always that I have
time to.

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you check out this [blogpost](https://blog.codelitt.com/contractor-to-cto/),it will answer **all** your questions.
