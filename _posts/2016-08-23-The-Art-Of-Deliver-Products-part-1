The good and at the same time bad thing about being a software engineer in the information era is that a lot of people want you to validate their big ideas. Ideas which are almost always to make millions as a lot of startups are *easily* doing. Since the majority of the rockstar startups were created upon simple ideas like WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram and so on, some people tend to believe that a thought is all that is needed to have success, which couldn't be more away from the truth.

Last week a friend asked me for a meeting because he wanted to talk about a big idea that was *Insert your big idea here*. He kept saying that everyone who he had spoken to, told him that it was great and he could make a lot of money from it. There he convinced me, the idea was good.

Now let's make some things clear, the final product that he had in mind could be good **if** and only if it was well created and the process well executed. He could get rich, but again, this is not only because of the idea itself.

When I started asking the questions that mattered most things got a little hot.

1 - Do you really need *EVERYTHING* from the final product to validate your idea?

For me this is the most important question about a soon to be product. We have the tendency to think that we can't validate an idea without having all of it done, then we spend tons of money just to see that after all it was not soo good. Another good thing about entering partially is that once we can meet some potential clients they can give their feedback which is gold.
  
  At this moment you need to answer the following question: *Can you enter partially in the market?*

2 - Do you have the money to build all of it?

  Because of the lack of knowledge some people tend to believe that a piece of software is cheap. They forget that developers need to be paid as well as other things like servers, email services, merchandising and so on.

  A recurring teory is that if you have an idea someone is going to put their money into it. If you check most of the startup pitch presentations you are going to notice that most of the time the investment is made in person/execution and that the idea is just something in the middle of it.
  
3 - How do you plan to enter in the market?

  For some people it is hard to believe that an application doesn't just appear in front of the end user and he loves it. It has to be seen somewhere, someone needs to say that it is good. A software that isn't seen by people who may want it isn't going to be used by the ones who don't even know that it exists.
  
Now the answers that he gave me:

1. Yes, because the competitors have some refinated products and yes he is in the [red ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy).
2. No, but I can get people to invest.
3. Not yet, but it is going to be worked out as soon as we have the product to show to some potential clients

Not good ones as you may notice. In the next part of the post I'm going to show how to approach the product definition and how manage the product delivery.
