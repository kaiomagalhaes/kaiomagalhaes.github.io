### my history

I've started as a software developer after two years doing Biological
Sciences. I was born to be a crazy cientist ( I discovered it when I was
6 ), but I'm just too stuborn to just accept how things are, so I
decided to be a Software Engineer instead and here I am.

I got a bachelor in Software Engineering in the [Universidade Federal de
Goiás](https://www.ufg.br/) in 2016.

My journey began in 2011 when I was a teacher in a really small college
in [Goiânia](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=goiânia&oq=goiânia) and
I had to make all my classes diaries by hand. Every two months I had to
write dots for 300 students. I then saw that I was in charge of a mission
to find a way to make this process better.

My first software never went to production because three months after I
drop out from that college and from the University only to enter again,
but for Software Engineer this time.

By then I've worked with a lot of projects in a lot of different
languages like PHP, C#, Java, Groovy and Ruby.

With a lot of frameworks like: Grails, Rails and NodeJS.

For a lot of plataforms like: Desktop, WEB, Android and Hololens.

I have worked as Linux Devops as well.

I love programming related topics like code quality, software engineer,
best practices, design patterns and I write about it always that I have
time to.

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
