My name is Kaio Magalhães. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### my history

I've started as a software developer after two years doing Biological
Ciences. I was born to be a crazy cientist ( I discovered it when I was
6 ), but I'm just too stuborn to just accept how things are, so I
decided to be a Software Engineer and here I am.


I got a bachelor in Software Engineering in the [Universidade Federal de
Goiás](https://www.ufg.br/) in 2016.

My journey began in 2011 when I was a teacher in a really small college
in [Goiânia](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=goiânia&oq=goiânia) and
I had to make my students diaries by hand. Every two months I had to
write dots for 300 students, I had to find a way to make this process
better.

My first software never went to production because three months after I
drop out from that college and from the University only to enter again,
but for Software Engineer this time.

By then I've worked with a lot of projects in a lot of different
languages. 



To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
